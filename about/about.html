                    <h3>And why she was chosen</h3>
                </hgroup>
                <p>When I was 13 my mother told me she was going to have another child. Being the only child my whole life I thought: "what a terrible idea, you already have me". But then Vianca happened. </p>
                <p>She was a special child, and still is. She is stubborn, but she's also determined. A little too extroverted, but only with anyone who's not her immediate family.</p>
                <p>She's become my best friend. But she would tell you otherwise.</p>
                <p>I decided to dedicate this website to her. Vianca is just now starting her life. I think having this record of what her life was the moment she passed the threshold into adulthood will help put in perspective what life is about.</p>
                <p>And maybe in the future she'll use it to show her children how terrible I was at designing.</p>
