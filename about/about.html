                    <h2>About Vianca</h2>
                <p>When I was 13 years old my mother told me she was going to have another child. Being the only child my whole life I thought: "what a terrible idea, you already have me". But then Vianca happened. </p>
                <p>Vianca A. Colon, born 2003 in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. She moved to Florida when she was only a month old. Recent high school graduate. Passionate about track and field, fireworks, flag football, nature, her friends, and Disney. Her favorite colors are blues and reds. </p>
                <p>She is a very special child. She is stubborn, but she's also determined. Extroverted, but only with anyone who's not her immediate family.</p>
                <p>Vianca admires her dad most of all as he is a veteran of the ARMY, and he works hard every day to provide for his family. "He's a great dad, and funny too!"</p>
                <p>When I asked her how she wants people to remember her she simply shrugged and said: “I would like for the people who know me to look at fireworks on a Fourth of July and say ‘This reminds me of Vianca’”.</p>
                <p>Her dream vacation includes going to Alaska and Norway to see the Northern Lights. Got to Hawaii for the beaches. And go to Paris for Disneyland.</p>
                <p>Her happiest memory as of right now is going to <em>Magic Kingdom</em> with her friends the day before graduating high school. They rode <em>Big Thunder Mountain</em> and were able to watch the castle fireworks as they were riding the rollercoaster. </p>
                <p>I decided to dedicate this website to her. Vianca is just now starting her life. I think having this record of what her life was like the moment she passed the threshold into adulthood will help her cherish her past and make better decisions in her future.</p>
                <br>
                <p>And maybe in the future she'll use it to show her children how terrible I was at designing.</p>
